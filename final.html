    <h1>Congratulations!</h1>
    <p>All right all right. You're in.</p>
    <p>You have proven you remember all the dorky encoding schemes,
        the ridiculous electronic puzzles, running around the neighborhood looking for numbers on light poles, 
        videos that make B-movies look good, and plot lines with more holes than a positive current flow. </p>
    <p>All in the name of giving you less candy (ironic, huh?).</p>
    <p>You are one of us, and for putting up with all the years of Easter shenanigans, you deserve at least one year of bonus treats with 
        no strings attached. </p>
    <p>Dig in and enjoy. Thanks for making this necessary. </p>
    <p>And fun!</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>(Then get ready for next year...)</p>
